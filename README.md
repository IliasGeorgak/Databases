## This is the SQL Functions and Triggers needed for the completion of the semester project offered by the Databases course
### Project
The objective of the project was to create a database system modeling the function of a school. It follows all the principles of proper database design and supports multiple functions for creating/ deleting/ updating entries.
Saddly however due to the nature of this course's lab I could not upload neither the projects requirements and ER models I derrived from them nor the sample data provided to me. So, if you are interested in my work, I kindly ask you to take the time and look through the file containing all the code I could retreive.
